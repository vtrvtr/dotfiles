## Compound Engineering (Pi compatibility)

This block is added by the pi-compound-engineering package.

Pi extensions used by skills shipped by this package:
- Required for full functionality: `pi-subagents` (by nicobailon) provides the `subagent` tool used by ce-compound, ce-code-review, ce-plan, ce-compound-refresh, and other parallel-agent skills.
- Recommended: `pi-ask-user` (by edlsh) provides the `ask_user` tool; skills fall back to numbered options in chat when it is missing.

Install with:
  pi install npm:pi-subagents
  pi install npm:pi-ask-user
